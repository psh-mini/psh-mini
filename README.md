# ‚ö° PSH-mini: Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity System  
### üèûÔ∏è Built at Seattle Climate Hacks 2025

HydroPulse is a functional prototype of a **pumped storage hydroelectricity system** with real-time hardware control, SCADA-style monitoring, and cloud-integrated data acquisition. Designed for resilience and sustainability, our system simulates the energy storage model used in grid-scale renewable systems, scaled for demonstration and educational use.

## Our Product

### üåä Physical System
A working scaled model of a pumped hydro system:
- **Upper and Lower Reservoirs** with visible flow simulation
- **DC Pump & Valve Actuators** controlled via microcontroller
- **Custom Generator Module** producing measurable electrical output
- **Current Sensors** sending generation output data
- **Flow Rate Sensors** monitoring hydrodynamic changes

### Hardware Interfacing
- **Microcontroller (TM4C1294NCPDT)** reads sensor data and controls devices
- Real-time communication via serial API over Bluetooth
- Support for manual override and system failsafe behaviors

### SCADA Interface
- Built a clean, responsive **React dashboard**
- Shows real-time valve and pump state
- Allows manual override control with visual feedback
- Displays live energy generation data and system health

### Cloud Data Platform
- Power generation, valve/pump state, and overrides sent to cloud
- Data stored in **Azure** for real-time syncing
- **Historical logs** accessible via dashboard for performance analytics
